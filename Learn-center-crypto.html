                  <p>
                    DEFINITION: A cryptocurrency (like bitcoin) is a digital asset used for investment or payments, which typically is not backed by any government or central bank and is usually based on a blockchain.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>

                <h3>Understanding Cryptocurrency</h3>
                <p>
                  Cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin and ether, fit squarely in the world of alternative finance. They provide users with the ability to make decentralized peer-to-peer transactions — that is, without relying on payment processing companies or banks. This is possible because cryptocurrencies usually operate on blockchains, digital ledgers maintained by global networks of computers.
                </p>

                <p style="background-color: #f6f9ff;">
                  <b>EXAMPLE:</b> Often described as “digital gold,” bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency. It was—and is—the first digital payments system based on a blockchain. The idea for bitcoin was first floated on a cryptography mailing list on Oct. 31, 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious person (or group) behind the cryptocurrency. However, the actual bitcoin network went live later, in January 2009.
                </p>

                <p style="background-color: #f6f9ff;">
                   For most of its existence, bitcoin traded for less than $1,000. There was a brief spike over $1,000 in 2014, but it wasn’t until 2017 that it really went mainstream. That year, between November and December 2017, bitcoin’s price more than doubled, even as economists and observers grew concerned that it was in a bubble. Bitcoin’s price plummeted just a few months later. You can find its current price here.
                </p>

                <h3>Takeaway</h3>

                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Cryptocurrencies aim for financial independence...
                  </p>
                </blockquote>

                <img src="assets/img/learn/Crypto_Illustration.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">

                <p>
                  In a world where many financial institutions charge their customers exorbitant fees, cryptocurrencies are pretty revolutionary. They offer a digital means to store wealth and transact, in some cases, independently of any company. Whether you buy cryptocurrencies with this in mind (or decide to pass on them altogether), these digital assets are founded on an ethos of decentralization. They strive to put financial power back in the hands of the people.

                <h3>How is a cryptocurrency different from a traditional currency?</h3>
                <p>
                  While the US dollar relies on government institutions (e.g., Congress, the Federal Reserve, and the US Treasury), cryptocurrencies are mostly beholden to code. This means they function based on parameters set by software developers. For instance, bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins, a limit set by its creator Satoshi Nakamoto. This is in contrast to government-backed currencies like the US dollar, whose supply is managed by the Federal Reserve and could theoretically be printed without limitation. As of January 2021, approximately 18.6 million bitcoins have been mined (but more on that later).
                </p>

                <h3>How does a cryptocurrency work?</h3>
                <p>
                  Blockchain. Blockchain. Blockchain. While not all cryptocurrencies are based on blockchain technology, it has almost become synonymous with bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Your friends may have dropped the term in conversation or perhaps you’ve seen it, referenced with the wave of a hand in an article about “the future of shipping.”
                </p>

                <p>
                  At its core, a blockchain is a digital record-keeping system. You might think of it as a distributed database. If you’re having trouble picturing a blockchain, you’re not alone. It might be easiest to think of a blockchain as a giant stone, placed in the middle of a village. Everybody can see what’s written on it and everybody knows who makes a change. It’s all out in the open, available for the public to view and participate — At least, that’s one way of thinking about it.
                </p>

                <h3>What are the types of cryptocurrencies? What are altcoins?</h3>
                <p>
                  Today, there are thousands of cryptocurrencies listed by price tracking websites, and many were inspired by or even drew directly from Bitcoin’s code. As a whole, these bitcoin alternatives are known as “altcoins” or alternative cryptocurrencies. Examples include litecoin and ether.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Here are some altcoins with large market capitalizations:
                </p>

                <p>
                <b><i class="bi bi-check2"></i>
                Litecoin (LTC):</b> Created by an MIT alum in 2011, litecoin was one of the first cryptocurrencies to come into existence after bitcoin. Litecoin is known for generating new blocks (which form the blockchain) at a faster pace, allowing for faster transactions.
                </p>

                <p>
                <b><i class="bi bi-check2"></i>
                Ethereum (ETH):</b> Younger than bitcoin and litecoin, the ethereum network was launched in 2015. In addition to its native currency, “ether,” the network is distinguished by its potential for decentralized applications (“Dapps”).
                </p>

                <p>
                <b><i class="bi bi-check2"></i>
                XRP:</b> Launched in 2012, XRP (often referred to as “Ripple”) is the digital currency associated with the XRP network. It is meant to enable immediate and low-cost payments worldwide. That touted use case has made it particularly relevant to banks looking to settle cross-border transactions using Ripple’s ledger. Unlike bitcoin, XRP doesn’t require mining, so some in the crypto community dispute whether XRP qualifies as a cryptocurrency.
                </p>

                <h3>What is cryptocurrency mining?</h3>
                <p>
                  Mining is the process of verifying records and adding transactions to a blockchain network. People who mine cryptocurrency often use specialized hardware, including application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) to optimize their profitability. In exchange for securing and maintaining cryptocurrency networks, miners can be eligible to receive block rewards (more on that below).
                </p>

                <h3>How long does it take to mine bitcoin?</h3>
                <p>
                  A new block is added to the bitcoin blockchain roughly once every 10 minutes. This results in a payout of the block reward, which is expected to remain at 6.25 bitcoins until 2024. Before your eyes light up with dollar signs though, you should know — for an individual miner, the odds of successfully mining a block are extraordinarily low. That’s why many miners join mining pools. (You might think of this like joining your office’s lottery pool.)
